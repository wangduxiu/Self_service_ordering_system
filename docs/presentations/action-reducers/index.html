    .title[Action reducers]
    ## implemented in typescript
    ### tailored for ngrx
    ---
    # Current situation
    --

    - Data is stored in store

    - Actions trigger state change

    - Reducers changes the state (using the payload in the actions)

    ---
    # Example
    ###the state

    ```javascript
    export interface Invoice {
      id: number;
      date: Date;
      amount: number;
    }

    export interface InvoiceDetail extends Invoice {
      items: Item[];
    }

    export interface State {
      invoice: {
        list: Invoice[];
        detail: InvoiceDetail;
      }
    }
    ```
    ---
    ### the action & reducer

    ```javascript

    export class ListLoadAction {
      type: 'LIST_LOAD';
    }

    export class ListLoadSuccessAction {
      type: 'LIST_LOAD_SUCCESS';
      constructor(payload: any) {}
    }


    export const reducer(state: State = INITIAL_STATE, action): State {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'LIST_LOAD':
          return {
            ...state,
            loading: true,
          };
        case 'LIST_LOAD_SUCCESS':
          return {
            ...state,
            loading: false,
            loaded: true,
            data: action.payload
          };
        }
    }
    ```
    ---

    ## And change the interfaces

    ```javascript
    export interface Invoice {
      id: number;
      date: Date;
      amount: number;
      loading: boolean;
      loaded: boolean;
      failed: boolean;
    }

    export interface InvoiceDetail extends Invoice {
      items: Item[];
      loading: boolean;
      loaded: boolean;
      failed: boolean;
    }
    ```

    ---

    # What's bad

    --

    - A lot of code to be written

    --

    - A log of bugs can be introduced

    --

    - A lot of code that does the same thing

    --

    - No guarantee that load, load-fail & load-success are always reduced the same way

    --

    ==> A lot of tests to be written

    ---

    # Solution !

    - Generate the code

    #### ng-del

    --

    # Let's check


    - ~~A lot of code to be written~~

    --

    - ~~A log of bugs can be introduced~~

    --

    - A lot of code that does the same thing

    --

    - No guarantee that load, load-fail & load-success are always reduced the same way

    --

    ==> A lot of tests to be written

    ---
    # A new approach: re-use
    ## Let's start with the data !

    --

    We need:

    - boolean *loading*
    - boolean *loaded*
    - boolean *failed*

    --

    BUT this is should not be part of the data, it's **metadata**

    --

    ```javascript
    export interface LoadState<T> {
      loading: boolean;
      loaded: boolean;
      failed: boolean;
      data: T;
    }
    ```
    ---
    ## The store:


    ```javascript
    export interface state {
      invoice: {
        list: LoadState<Invoice[]>;
        detail: LoadState<InvoiceDetail>;
      }
    }
    ```
    ---

    ## How can we abstract the actions and the reducers ?

    --

    ### Create a class for that !

    --

    - containing functions to create actions

    ```javascript
    export class LoadActionReducer<ID, TYPE> {
        constructor(private actionReducerId: string){}

        reset() {
          return {
            type: this.actionReducerId + '_RESET'
          }
        }
        load(payload?: ID) {
          return {
            type: this.actionReducerId + '_LOAD',
            payload: {id: payload}
          }
        }
        loadSuccess(payload: TYPE) {
           ...
        }
        loadFail(payload: ID) {
           ...
        }
        ...
    ```

    ---

    - containing a reducer function to handle reduce
    ```javascript
        ...

        reducer(state: LoadState<TYPE> = INITIAL_LOAD_STATE, action): LoadState<TYPE> {
          let newState = state;
          newState = this.reduceReset(newState, action);
          newState = this.reduceLoad(newState, action);
          newState = this.reduceLoadSuccess(newState, action);
          newState = this.reduceLoadFail(newState, action);
          return newState;
        }

        private reduceReset(state, action) {
          if (action.type === this.actionReducerId + '_RESET') {
            return {
              ...INITIAL_LOAD_STATE, // Make a copy !!!
            }
          }
          return newState;
        }
        private reduceLoad(state, action) {
          if (action.type === this.actionReducerId + 'LOAD') {
            return {
              ...state,
              ...INITIAL_LOAD_STATE,
              loading: true,
            }
          }
          return newState;
        }
        ...
      }
    ```

    ---

    ## ActionReducers in practice

    ### In the sandbox

    ```javascript
    loadInvoices() {

        this.store.dispatch(invoicesActionReducer.load());

        this.invoiceRestService.getInvoices().subscribe(
            (invoices: Invoice[]) => {
                this.store.dispatch(invoicesActionReducer.loadSuccess(invoices);
            },
            (error) => {
                this.store.dispatch(invoicesActionReducer.loadFail();
            });
    }
    ```

    ---

    ### The reducer

    ```javascript
    // Interface
    export interface InvoiceState {
        list: LoadState<Invoice[]>;
        detail: LoadState<InvoiceDetail>;
    }

    // Action-reducers
    export const invoicesActionReducer
                = new LoadActionReducer<string, Invoice[]>('INVOICES');
    export const invoiceDetailActionReducer
                = new LoadActionReducer<string, InvoiceDetail>('INVOICE_DETAIL');

    // Reducer
    const combinedReducer: ActionReducer<InvoiceState> = combineReducers({
        list: invoicesActionReducer.reducer,
        detail: invoiceDetailActionReducer.reducer,
    });

    export function reducer(state: InvoiceState, action: any): InvoiceState {
        return combinedReducer(state, action);
    }

    ```

    ---

    ### And finally in the store

    ```javascript
    import * as fromInvoice from '@app/core/store/invoice/invoice.reducer';

    export interface State {
        invoice: InvoiceState;
        ...
    }

    const stateMap = {
        invoice: fromInvoice.reducer,
        ...
    }

    ```

    --

    ### ps: Credendo currently contains 51 action-reducers
    ###   ... and we're only halfway
    ---
    # It's not all !

    --

    ## Can be combined with old style actions & reducers
    - It's even possible to override the reducer of an action-reducer

    ```javascript
      list: arrayOfReducers<LoadState<Invoice[]>>([
          invoicesActionReducer.reducer,
          invoicesCustomReducer // For submit action
      ]),
    ```

    --

    ## Different flavors

    - Object or Array
    --

    - Also add, update or create, delete
    --

    - Pessimistic vs optimistic updates

    # Other extensions

    ## A guard

    A way to ensure that the data is loaded before rendering a page, or be redirected if data not available / not allowed

    ![alt guard](guard-flow.png "Title")

    ---
    ### How to implement (subclass) a guard:

    ```javascript
    @Injectable()
    export class InvoiceDetailGuard extends BaseGuard<InvoiceDetail> {
      constructor(
        private store: Store<State>,
        private invoiceDetailSandbox: InvoiceDetailSandbox,
        routerService: RouterService) {
          super(routerService, 'invoices');
      }

      getState(): Observable<LoadState<InvoiceDetail>> {
        return this.store.select(state => state.invoice.detail);
      }

      triggerLoad(params: any): void {
        this.invoiceDetailSandbox.loadInvoiceDetail(params.id);
      }

      triggerReset(): void {
        this.invoiceDetailSandbox.resetInvoiceDetail();
      }

      checkVersion(detail: InvoiceDetail, params: any): boolean {
        return detail.id === params.id;
      }
    }
    ```

    ---
    ### And register it on the path

    In the route.module.ts:

    ```javascript
    export const routes: Routes = [
      {
        path: 'invoice/detail/:id',
        pathMatch: 'full',
        canActivate: [UserGuard, AuthorizationGuard, InvoiceDetailGuard],
        component: InvoiceDetailContainer
      }
    }
    ```
